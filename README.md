# YouTube Uploader Manager

A web frontend for the CLI tool youtubeuploader https://github.com/porjo/youtubeuploader

## Roadmap

* [ ] Create a script that watch a given folder and uploads every new video that is dropped in it (with the default youtubeuploader options)
* [ ] Edit the script in order to wait for a *.json file (with the same name of the video file) and use the information in it for the youtubeuploader options (title, description, ecc.)
* [ ] Create a web application to show the status of the current upload
* [ ] Manage the video info through the app
* [ ] Add the concurrent upload of multiple videos (is it allowed by the YouTube API?)
* [ ] Add the ability manage different drop-in folders
* [ ] Add the ability to create the `client_secrets.json` and `request.token` through the web app
* [ ] Multi-account support? (changes needed on the main script)
